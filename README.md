### Hi there 👋

I'm a Master's graduate from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, specializing in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing. My expertise lies in applying these technologies to legal documents and the justice system.

#### 📖 Master's degree project 
-  Title: "Case Law Analysis with Machine Learning in Brazilian Court"
-  This research involved the automatic extraction of judicial decisions from web pages and their processing through Natural Language Processing techniques.
-  Subsequently, this data was used in the development of Machine Learning models to classify documents based on the judge's ruling.
-  The necessary statistical tests were also developed to validate the findings.
-  Finally, graphs and dashboards were created to enable analysis by stakeholders.
-  🚀 It received over 20 academic citations, and its presentation (in English) at a conference in Canada. [Link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=pt-BR&user=4yppHS4AAAAJ&citation_for_view=4yppHS4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC)
